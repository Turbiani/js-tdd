If `g` is as above and `_` is [`R.__`](#__),\n * the following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curryN\n * @example\n *\n *      var addFourNumbers = (a, b, c, d) => a + b + c + d;\n *\n *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curry(addFourNumbers);\n *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      var g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\nvar curry = /*#__PURE__*/__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__internal_curry1__[\"a\" /* default */])(function curry(fn) {\n  return __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__curryN__[\"a\" /* default */])(fn.length, fn);\n});\n/* harmony default export */ __webpack_exports__[\"a\"] = (curry);\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 77 */\n/***/ (function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\n/* harmony import */ var __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__internal_curry2__ = __webpack_require__(0);\n/* harmony import */ var __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__internal_dispatchable__ = __webpack_require__(7);\n/* harmony import */ var __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__internal_filter__ = __webpack_require__(80);\n/* harmony import */ var __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__internal_isObject__ = __webpack_require__(83);\n/* harmony import */ var __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4__internal_reduce__ = __webpack_require__(15);\n/* harmony import */ var __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__internal_xfilter__ = __webpack_require__(301);\n/* harmony import */ var __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_6__keys__ = __webpack_require__(21);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/**\n * Takes a predicate and a `Filterable`, and returns a new filterable of the\n * same type containing the members of the given filterable which satisfy the\n * given predicate.
